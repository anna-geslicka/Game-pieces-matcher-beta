# Game-pieces-matcher
 
Game pieces matcher is a program I'm creating for a befriended bar, that allows renting board games (about 100 games).
Customers often lose individual pieces and bartenders have trouble matching them to a specific game.
In this project I want to use an ORB image recognition algorithm, to create a quick application that will help them match items to a specific game.
Work in progress :)
